                <p>My name is Josh C.S. Lewis. I am currently studying programming through the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Theatre from Armstrong State University in Savannah, Georgia. I have lived many places as my father is in the military therefore, I am from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. I am quite used to change and loved moving around. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I have a beautiful wife named Bobbie Renee whom I met at Armstrong and we have been married for a little over a year now.</p>
                
                <p>I am a massive geek. I love any and all games, especially board games. I am a huge Harry Potter fan. (Ravenclaw for life) I am an actor by degree and love but I am also a "jack of all trades" kinda guy. I have dabbled in a lot of different obsessions over the years but never really became great at one thing. I am currently a bartender and server at Atlantic - a neighborhood eatery in Savannah but I am looking to make a career change through this coding program. I have always had an interest in the tech field and I am excited at the opportunity that this class offers.</p>
